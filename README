Ran this on a Linux system with a GeForce GTX 760 GPU.

Program compiles and runs correctly for both 3D and 2D.

Usage:

The Makfile will create two executables: 3dtri and 2dtri. They are
both used the same:
  ./3dtri <exponent-for-data-set-size> <num-blks> <num-threads>

If you want to have 2^14 input points, using 6 blocks, and 192 threads
per block, then:

  ./3dtri 14 6 192

When you run the program, it will geenrate a txt file in ./output/, the
file will list the input points and the corresponding trilateration
points. The file will have a name corresponding to the run and the
paramters.

To run all combinations for both 2d and 3d, you need to have python3 
installed. The file driver.py will run all combinations, producing
two images: results-3d.png and results-2d.png. It will also create
all of the text files showing the data in the ./output/ dir.
